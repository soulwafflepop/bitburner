# BitBurner Scripts

Here are all of the scripts I use in BitBurner

I am a new programmer and I am using this game to help learn Javascript and general computer science procedures

A lot of my code is inefficient, but feel free to use it if you want

Keep in mind that I use some scripts from other people, particularly [alainbryden](https://github.com/alainbryden/bitburner-scripts/tree/main)
